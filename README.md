# XGBoost Project â€“ Theory and Implementation

This repository contains both the **theoretical foundation** and the **practical implementation** of an XGBoost-based analysis applied to financial data.

## Repository Structure

- **1 - Data explanation.pdf**  
  Theoretical description of the dataset and preprocessing steps.

- **2 - XGBoost Theory.pdf**  
  Introduction to XGBoost: theoretical background, machine learning context, and algorithmic principles.

- **3 - Performance Metrics.pdf**  
  Explanation of the evaluation metrics used to compare models.

- **XGboost.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation of the XGBoost regression model, including data loading, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

- **AAPL.csv**  
  Sample dataset (Apple Inc. stock data) used in the analysis.

- **LICENSE, .gitignore, .gitattributes**  
  Standard repository configuration files.

## How to Use
1. Read the PDFs to get an overview of the **theoretical aspects**.  
2. Open `XGboost.ipynb` to explore the **code implementation** step by step.  
3. Use `AAPL.csv` as input data to replicate the experiments.  

---

ðŸ“Œ **Key idea:** Theory is provided in the PDFs for context and background, while the Jupyter Notebook (`XGboost.ipynb`) contains the actual executable workflow.
